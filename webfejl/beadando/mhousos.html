        <h2>Mhousos beginnings</h2>
        <p>The Rustbeard’s family history is intertwined with the proud tradition of dwarven machinery.
            Most of the members were esteemed siege tank operators or flying machine pilots in the
            Second War. So it was not a big surprise that Mhousos was quite adept in the fine art of
            engineering as well. After all, he had arclight spanners and gyromatic micro-adjustors as toys in
            his younger years.</p>
        <p> What comes as a surprise, however, is that he had an aptitude to wielding the Holy Light as
            well. There was a great debate regarding his future amongst the family. Some wanted him to be
            a warrior like his forebearer, some wanted him to join the Explorers League, and some wanted
            him to join the Church of the Holy Light.</p>     
        <p>
            Well, Mhouses just did all that. He is a brave Dwarf Paladin, specialized in undead-slaying, but
            is regarded highly amongst the dwarfs as a tinkerer. 
        </p>   
        <p>
            Even the gnomes have noticed his bright mind. In Loch Modan he helped out with the Trogg
infestation and joined the Explorer’s Leage right there and there. He is fascinated with the old
history of the dwarves and tries to learn what role the Holy Light played in the creation of the
dwarves. Did it guide the Titans during the forming of his forebearers?
