                    <p>The Rustbeard’s family history is intertwined with the proud tradition of dwarven machinery.
                    Most of the members were esteemed siege tank operators or flying machine pilots in the
                    Second War. So it was not a big surprise that Mhousos was quite adept in the fine art of
                    engineering as well. After all, he had arclight spanners and gyromatic micro-adjustors as toys in
                    his younger years.</p>
                    <p> What comes as a surprise, however, is that he had an aptitude to wielding the Holy Light as
                    well. There was a great debate regarding his future amongst the family. Some wanted him to be
                    a warrior like his forebearer, some wanted him to join the Explorers League, and some wanted
                    him to join the Church of the Holy Light.</p>     
                    <p>
                    Well, Mhouses just did all that. He is a brave Dwarf Paladin, specialized in undead-slaying, but
                    is regarded highly amongst the dwarfs as a tinkerer. 
                    </p>   
                    <p>
                    Even the gnomes have noticed his bright mind. In Loch Modan he helped out with the Trogg
                    infestation and joined the Explorer’s Leage right there and there. He is fascinated with the old
                    history of the dwarves and tries to learn what role the Holy Light played in the creation of the
                    dwarves. Did it guide the Titans during the forming of his forebearers?

                    Engineering and paladins. An odd pairing, but an effective one. Mhousos is often the tank in a
                5-man party, he is the one getting his hands dirty and facing the enemies head on. Having some
                explosives always helps in this regard.

                <p>
                    While Mhousos enjoys partying up with Mhousi and her pets, Husilaci sometimes gets carried
                away and initiates combat with enemies that needed no such action. There’s been plenty of
                hairy situations due to this, and the Advancend Target Dummy helps immensely. The diversion
                provided by the weird contraption is what the party usually needs to cast some healing spells or
                tend to the wounds with more mundane methods.
