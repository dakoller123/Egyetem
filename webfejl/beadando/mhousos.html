            <img src="assets/mhousos.jpg" alt="Portrait of Mhousos" longdesc="TODO"> 
            <p>A brave Dwarf Paladin specialized in undead-slaying. Among his many great assets shines
                engineering through. He is also a highly regarded amongst the dwarfs as a tinkerer.</p>

            <h2>Mhousos beginnings</h2>
            <p>The Rustbeard’s family history is intertwined with the proud tradition of dwarven machinery.
                Most of the members were esteemed siege tank operators or flying machine pilots in the
                Second War. So it was not a big surprise that Mhousos was quite adept in the fine art of
                engineering as well. After all, he had arclight spanners and gyromatic micro-adjustors as toys in
                his younger years.</p>
            <p> What comes as a surprise, however, is that he had an aptitude to wielding the Holy Light as
                well. There was a great debate regarding his future amongst the family. Some wanted him to be
                a warrior like his forebearer, some wanted him to join the Explorers League, and some wanted
                him to join the Church of the Holy Light.</p>     
            <p>
                Well, Mhouses just did all that. He is a brave Dwarf Paladin, specialized in undead-slaying, but
                is regarded highly amongst the dwarfs as a tinkerer. 
            </p>   
            <p>
                Even the gnomes have noticed his bright mind. In Loch Modan he helped out with the Trogg
    infestation and joined the Explorer’s Leage right there and there. He is fascinated with the old
    history of the dwarves and tries to learn what role the Holy Light played in the creation of the
    dwarves. Did it guide the Titans during the forming of his forebearers?

            <p>
                Mhousos is currently travelling across Azeroth, searching for ancient relics, uncovering
                mysteries and helping those who need it. Currently he is preparing for the Scarlet Monastery,
                once a beacon of knowledge, to retrieve some books for the League

            <h2>Favourites</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Zone: Duskwood</h3>
                <img src="assets/duskwood.jpg" alt="Mhousos and the Night Watch face of Stitches in Duskwood" longdesc="Mhousos and 4 people of the Night Watch standing together on the road in Duskwood, while Sitches, a big Abomination is walkling towards them.">        
                <p>An eerie, dark place, full on sorrow and pain. The Embalber, the risen corpse of Mogran and the
                    evil necromancer Morbent Fell all had to be stopped, in the name of the Light! Killing undeads is
                    what paladins are good at and Mhousos is a prime example for that.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Quest: Scythe of Elune</h3>
                <img src="assets/ding.jpg" alt="Mhousos leveling up while talking to a son of Cenarious" longdesc="Mhousi is watching Mhousos talking to a Keeper of the Grove. Mhousos has just turned in a quest and leveled up.">
                <p>What first starts out as multiple small, unrelated quests ends up being one giant investigation
                    with one item at it’s center: The Scythe of Elune. ‘Tis a real shame it didn’t continue in
                    Shadowfang Keep.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Dungeon: Blackfathom Deeps</h3>
                <img src="assets/bfd.png" alt="Mhousos, Mhousi, Cicánka killing nagas in Blackfathom Deeps" longdesc="Mhosuos is tanking a naga sorcerer while Cicánka, Mhousi's cat pet is flanking the enemy and Mhousi is shooting it from behind.">
                <p>Ancient Kaldorei secrets to uncover? Cursed naga and demons to exorcise? Crazed Old God
                    cultists to defeat and ancient beasts to battle? What’s not to love?</p>        
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Skill: Engineering</h3>
                <img src="assets/bfd.png" alt="Mhousos handling a big machine" longdesc="Mhousos is handling a big contraption in the corner in Ironforge's Tinkerer Town district with a gnome engineer supervising it.">
                <p>
                    Engineering and paladins. An odd pairing, but an effective one. Mhousos is often the tank in a
    5-man party, he is the one getting his hands dirty and facing the enemies head on. Having some
    explosives always helps in this regard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Mhousos enjoys partying up with Mhousi and her pets, Husilaci sometimes gets carried
    away and initiates combat with enemies that needed no such action. There’s been plenty of
    hairy situations due to this, and the Advancend Target Dummy helps immensely. The diversion
    provided by the weird contraption is what the party usually needs to cast some healing spells or
    tend to the wounds with more mundane methods.
