                A fierce and talented young Dwarf Hunter who is always ready to praise the Alliance with some
                honorable Horde kills and never afraid of the deepest and darkest dungeons in the World of
                Warcraft.

            Mhousi beginnings
            <p>
                Mhousi is from Dun Morogh as all Dwarves and Gnomes. When the idea of a Dwarf Hunter
    came up, a usual red haired male Dwarf was the first choice. Building on the image of Gimli
    from Lord of the Rings many WoW players choose this look for their Dwarves.
            </p>
            <p>
    However, playing in a couple would have been weird with two male charachters and there came
    the idea of Mhousi. Of course choosing the right name is always hard. We have to admit, we
    were inspired by a WoW name generator, and adapted it to our liking.

The gryphon and the dwarf on top of it are located in the center, currently aiming up and right, trying to climb through the air in a parallel direction to the slope of the snowy mountain.">        
                <h3>Zone: Dun Morogh</h3>
                <p>As a true Dwarf, Mhousi’s favourite zone is Dun Morogh. She loves the all year long cold and
                    snow in the area and likes to get lost in the mountains and forest of her homeland.
                    Although, she is always out and about discovering new lands and waters, when she is in
                    Ironforge, she always stops by and visits her favourite tutor, Tinkmaster Overspark.</p>

                <img src="assets/dun_morough.jpg" alt="TODO" longdesc="TODO">        
                <p>While her heart belongs to Dun Morogh, Mhousi is always eager to quest in far away places.
                    From what she has seen up until today, Mhousi loves Ashenvale and its quests, Raene’s
                    Cleansing in particular. As it allows her to take Furbolg form from time to time, since she kept
                    Dartol’s Rod of Transformation but pssst..</p>

                <img src="assets/dun_morough.jpg" alt="TODO" longdesc="TODO">        
                <p>Being the longest dungeon, Gnomeregan is tough to conquer but it is worth it. Growing up in
                    Dun Morogh meant a close relationship with the Gnomes built on trust and brotherhood.
                    Therefore Mhousi is always glad to go back to his friend’s home to pay respect by killing
                    hideous Troggs.</p>

                <h3>Pets and hobbies</h3>
                <img src="assets/deb_dwarf.jpg" alt="TODO" longdesc="TODO">        
                <p>Mhousi has explored working with three pets so far. She had the strongest bond with Husilaci
                    being her first pet, a grey Crag Boar from Dun Morogh. They were together up until level 15 and
                    grew very close, also with Mhousos.
                    However, the time came for a change. While a boar has its advantages it is not the best tank as
                    it does not have a high enough DPS (damage per second).</p>
                    <p>Once in Kalimdor, the choice was obvious for a Moonstalker. Cicánka was a great companion,
                        she had many great skills to pass over to future pets, like cower, growl and claw. However,
                        Mhousi always knew she was not really a cat person. They spent some time together but did not
                        make history.
                       </p>
    
                        <p>Today, Mhousi works together with Palikutya a Ghostpaw Runner from Ashenvale. Palikutya is
    a great pal, he quickly learned all the skills Cicánka possessed, and keeps learning and
    developing at lightspeed.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>Palikutya is particularly strong in attack and acquired all major armor skills (frost, arcane,
                            fire, …). One of his greatest virtue is, however, loyalty. He follows Mhousi down into thedeapest and scariest dungeons. What is more, he often even leads the way and helps
                            Mhousi out in mapping unknown areas.</p>
