                        <h2>Mhousi beginnings...</h2>
                        <p>
                            Mhousi is from Dun Morogh as all Dwarves and Gnomes. When the idea of a Dwarf Hunter
                came up, a usual red haired male Dwarf was the first choice. Building on the image of Gimli
                from Lord of the Rings many WoW players choose this look for their Dwarves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                However, playing in a couple would have been weird with two male charachters and there came
                the idea of Mhousi. Of course choosing the right name is always hard. We have to admit, we
                were inspired by a WoW name generator, and adapted it to our liking.

                        Although, she is always out and about discovering new lands and waters, when she is in
                        Ironforge, she always stops by and visits her favourite tutor, Tinkmaster Overspark.</p>

                        From what she has seen up until today, Mhousi loves Ashenvale and its quests, Raene’s
                        Cleansing in particular. As it allows her to take Furbolg form from time to time, since she kept

                        Dun Morogh meant a close relationship with the Gnomes built on trust and brotherhood.
                        Therefore Mhousi is always glad to go back to his friend’s home to pay respect by killing
                        hideous Troggs.</p>

                <p>Mhousi has explored working with three pets so far. She had the strongest bond with Husilaci
                    being her first pet, a grey Crag Boar from Dun Morogh. They were together up until level 15 and
                    grew very close, also with Mhousos.
                    However, the time came for a change. While a boar has its advantages it is not the best tank as
                    it does not have a high enough DPS (damage per second).</p>

                    she had many great skills to pass over to future pets, like cower, growl and claw. However,
                    Mhousi always knew she was not really a cat person. They spent some time together but did not

                    a great pal, he quickly learned all the skills Cicánka possessed, and keeps learning and
                    developing at lightspeed.

                                            fire, …). One of his greatest virtue is, however, loyalty. He follows Mhousi down into thedeapest and scariest dungeons. What is more, he often even leads the way and helps
                                            Mhousi out in mapping unknown areas.</p>
