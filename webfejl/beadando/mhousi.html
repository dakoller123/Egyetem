            A fierce and talented young Dwarf Hunter who is always ready to praise the Alliance with some
            honorable Horde kills and never afraid of the deepest and darkest dungeons in the World of
            Warcraft.

        <h2>Mhousi beginnings</h2>
        Mhousi beginnings
        <p>
            Mhousi is from Dun Morogh as all Dwarves and Gnomes. When the idea of a Dwarf Hunter
came up, a usual red haired male Dwarf was the first choice. Building on the image of Gimli
from Lord of the Rings many WoW players choose this look for their Dwarves.
        </p>
        <p>
However, playing in a couple would have been weird with two male charachters and there came
the idea of Mhousi. Of course choosing the right name is always hard. We have to admit, we
were inspired by a WoW name generator, and adapted it to our liking.

The gryphon and the dwarf on top of it are located in the center, currently aiming up and right, trying to climb through the air in a parallel direction to the slope of the snowy mountain.">        
            <h3>Zone: Dun Morogh</h3>
            <p>As a true Dwarf, Mhousi’s favourite zone is Dun Morogh. She loves the all year long cold and
                snow in the area and likes to get lost in the mountains and forest of her homeland.
                Although, she is always out and about discovering new lands and waters, when she is in
                Ironforge, she always stops by and visits her favourite tutor, Tinkmaster Overspark.</p>

            <h3>Questline: Raene’s Cleansing</h3>
            <img src="assets/dun_morough.jpg" alt="Mhousi riding a gryphon through Dun Morough" longdesc="TODO">        
            <p>While her heart belongs to Dun Morogh, Mhousi is always eager to quest in far away places.
                From what she has seen up until today, Mhousi loves Ashenvale and its quests, Raene’s
                Cleansing in particular. As it allows her to take Furbolg form from time to time, since she kept
                Dartol’s Rod of Transformation but pssst..</p>

            <h3>Dungeon:Gnomeregan </h3>
            <img src="assets/dun_morough.jpg" alt="Mhousi riding a gryphon through Dun Morough" longdesc="TODO">        
            <p>Being the longest dungeon, Gnomeregan is tough to conquer but it is worth it. Growing up in
                Dun Morogh meant a close relationship with the Gnomes built on trust and brotherhood.
                Therefore Mhousi is always glad to go back to his friend’s home to pay respect by killing
                hideous Troggs.</p>
